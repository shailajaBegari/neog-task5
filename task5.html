            <h1 aria-setsize="100"  >TASK1 QUIZE</h1>
            <p>quiz, a contest in which participants test what they know by answering questions on one or more topics.
                The term quiz is a capacious one: it can refer to a single game consisting of just a few questions, or it can refer to a large-scale event involving dozens or hundreds of people. Quizzes may be held on a variety of subjects, or they may be on just one. Quiz formats also vary widely, ranging from weekly quizzes at a local pub, with participants competing for glory (and perhaps a few free pints), to widely broadcast television game shows such as Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, with enormous cash prizes on offer.</p>

            <h1 aria-setsize="200"   >HISTORY OF QUIZE</h1>
            <p>No evidence of quizzing has been found in records from the ancient and medieval periods. If ancient Romans or Aboriginal peoples quizzed, they did not leave anything that shows it. The earliest known appearance of the word quiz in print, according to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), is surprisingly recent—1782—and the word then referred to an odd-looking person. The etymology of the word is unknown. A widely repeated anecdote ascribes the word’s invention to Richard Daly, the manager of a Dublin theatre. As one version of the story goes, he wagered that he could cause a word of no meaning to become the talk of the town within 48 hours and to acquire a definite, widely adopted meaning within a week. Accordingly, he had the letters Q, U, I, and Z written across doors and shutters all over Dublin. The subsequent public response led to his winning the wager. </p>
